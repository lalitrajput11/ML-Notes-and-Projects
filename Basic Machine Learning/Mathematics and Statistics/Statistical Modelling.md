### 1) Descriptive statistics:

It includes analyzing, summarizing, organizing data in the form of numbers and graphs.

Types: Measure of central tendency- Mean, mode, median Measure of dispersion- range, variance, standard deviation

Graphs: bar plot, histogram, pie chart, pdf, cdf, normal distribution etc.

Here we take population or sample data and analyze, summarize, explore , visualize the data in the form of number and graphs.

### 2) Inferential statistics:


It is a technique wherein we use the data that we have measured to form conclusions.

eg: To get exit poll results during elections, we can take different samples from different locations from entire population , we are taking some sample and make inferences about population and coming to a conclusion like which party will win.

We take a sample from population and then we try to do some kind of test and then we come up with some inference and conclusion for that population.

It includes confidence interval , z- test, t-test, chi-square test etc.

### Key Concepts and Definitions

|Term|Definition|Notation/Example|
|---|---|---|
|Population|Entire set of items/people of interest in a study|Denoted by uppercase **N**|
|Sample|Subset of the population used for analysis|Denoted by lowercase **n**|
|Parameter|Numeric characteristic of a population|Example: population mean (\mu)|
|Statistic|Numeric characteristic of a sample|Example: sample mean (\bar{x})|
|Random Sample|Sample where every member has an equal chance of being selected|Ensures representativeness and randomness|
|Representative Sample|Sample accurately reflecting the characteristics of the population|Essential for valid inferences|
|Categorical Data|Data representing categories or groups|Examples: car brands, yes/no answers|
|Numerical Data|Data represented by numbers, subdivided into discrete and continuous|Discrete: number of children; Continuous: weight|
|Levels of Measurement|Qualitative (nominal, ordinal) and Quantitative (interval, ratio)|Nominal: no order; Ordinal: ordered categories|

### Types of Data and Measurement Levels

- **Categorical Data**:
    
    - Nominal (no order): car brands, seasons
    - Ordinal (ordered): rating scales (e.g., lunch rating from disgusting to delicious)
- **Numerical Data**:
    
    - Discrete: countable values (number of children, grades on a test)
    - Continuous: infinitely divisible values (weight, height, time)
- **Measurement Levels**:
    
    - Nominal and Ordinal for qualitative data
    - Interval (no true zero, e.g., Celsius temperature) and Ratio (true zero exists, e.g., weight, age) for quantitative data

### Measures of Central Tendency

- **Mean**: Average value; sensitive to outliers
- **Median**: Middle value in ordered data; robust against outliers
- **Mode**: Most frequent value; useful for categorical and numerical data

**Key Insight:** Use mean, median, and mode together for comprehensive understanding; none alone suffices.

### Measures of Asymmetry (Skewness)

- **Positive/Right Skew**: Mean > Median; tail on the right
- **Symmetrical Distribution**: Mean = Median = Mode; no skew
- **Negative/Left Skew**: Mean < Median; tail on the left

**Importance:** Skewness helps understand data distribution and interpret central tendency correctly.

### Relationship Between Variables

- **Covariance**: Measures direction of linear relationship; can be positive, zero, or negative; unstandardized scale.
    
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Standardized covariance; ranges from -1 to 1; easy to interpret strength and direction of relationship.
    
    - (+1): perfect positive correlation
    - 0: no correlation (independence)
    - (-1): perfect negative correlation

**Important Note:** Correlation does **not** imply causation. Example: House size positively correlates with price, but price does not cause size.

### Practical Real Estate Data Example

- **Data Overview:** Dataset from a California real estate company, including product info (property ID, price, area) and partial customer info (age, gender, location).
    
- **Variable Types and Levels:**
    
    - ID: Categorical, Nominal
    - Age: Quantitative, Ratio (discrete or continuous depending on use)
    - Price: Quantitative, Ratio, continuous
    - Gender: Categorical, Nominal (binary)
    - Location (State): Categorical, Nominal
- **Findings:**
    
    - Gender distribution biased by contract signatories; males more frequent but may not reflect entire buyer demographics.
    - Majority of sales (68%) from California; Pareto diagram suggests focusing marketing on top states.
    - Age distribution: Most buyers between 26-55 years; mean age ~46, right skewed, standard deviation ~13 years.
    - No significant correlation between age and price of property purchased (correlation coefficient = -0.17, considered negligible).
    - Stronger correlation expected between property size and price (exercise suggested for practice).

### Conclusions & Recommendations

- **Statistical tools** like measures of central tendency, variability, correlation, and data visualization are essential for understanding and making decisions based on data.
- **Samples** must be random and representative for reliable inference; population data is often inaccessible.
- **Visualizing data appropriately** (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) aids understanding and communication.
- **Multiple measures** should be used together (mean, median, mode; variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation) for a complete picture.
- **Correlation analysis** is crucial but must be interpreted carefully to avoid confusing correlation with causation.
- Practical application to business datasets enables targeted marketing and resource allocation.

### Key Insights

- Understanding **data types and measurement levels** is foundational before analysis.
- **Random and representative samples** are critical for accuracy in statistics.
- **Measures of central tendency and variability** provide complementary views of data distribution.
- **Visualization techniques** must match data types for clarity.
- **Covariance and correlation** quantify relationships but require cautious interpretation regarding causality.
- Practical examples underscore the value of statistics in real business decision-making.
