The term “Object-Oriented Programming” (OOP), also known as OOPs principles in python, was coined by Alan Kay around 1966 while he was at grad school. The language called **Simula** was the first programming language with the features of Object-oriented programming. It was developed in 1967 for making [**simulation programs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), in which the most important information was called objects.

Though OOPs were in the market since the early 1960s it was in the 1990s that OOPs began to grow because of C++.

## What Is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in python?

In Python, OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and classes to create programs. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object, and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program. Main principles of OOPs in Python are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
